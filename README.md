## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- SASS

### What I learned

I was able to make use of the pseudo-elements gracefully and create awesome background effects. It was also nice working with CSS inorder to make it even cooler. Mobile First approach is really stealing the show for me. I'd recommend it to everyone who's new in here. I was also able to know much in detail about flexbox properties.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.flextry {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

Really looking forward in working with much more complex CSS styles. I will be working on understanding flexbox and grid concepts in detail so that it'd be easier for me as I move along.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has been my first line of contact when I was stuck at stages. It usually solved all my quests.
